# Interactive Decision Tree Visualization - supertree
The supertree library is used for interactive visualization of decision trees with the D3 library. Such visualizations serve multiple purposes, including improving model interpretation by showing the decision-making process in an intuitive, graphical format. They highlight important features, assist in debugging and validating models, and make it easier to explain complex algorithms to non-technical stakeholders. Additionally, they are valuable educational tools, helping to illustrate the workings of decision-based models in a clear and interactive manner.
